![Overview of Uses of Nouns](https://vaporfigurebed.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/blogimg/Overview%20of%20Uses%20of%20Nouns.png)

### Nouns as Subjects

A noun that names the person(s) or thing(s) about which a statement is
to be made is labeled the subject,which includes **simple and compound
subjects**.

-   Who:people

-   What:inanimate objects

### Nouns as Subject Complements

A subject complement **describes or renames** the subject.


![EXAMPLE](https://vaporfigurebed.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com//blogimg/winner.png)

-   Linking verbs help to make a statement not by expressing an action,
    but by serving as a link between the subject and the subject
    complement.

-   $Am, are, is, was$, and $were$ are all forms of the most commonly
    used linking verb $to\quad be$.

-   Any form of $to\quad be$, when it acts as a linking verb, can be
    represented by an equals sign.

### Possessive Nouns

-   To show relationship or ownership of a noun,add an apostrophe.

-   Use $of$ instead of the apostrophe, and switch the order of the
    nouns.

EXAMPLES:the pool's diving board = the diving board of the pool

### What Is a Sentence?

Units are composed of different parts that we will call building
blocks.
![EXAMPLE](https://vaporfigurebed.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com//blogimg/fun.png)

### Nouns as Direct Objects

The direct object , which need **action verbs** [^1], is a word or
group of words that directly receives the action expressed by the verb.

### Nouns as Objects of Prepositions

A noun used after a preposition is called the object of the preposition.


![EXAMPLE](https://vaporfigurebed.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com//blogimg/Ben.png)

# ADJECTIVES
![Summary of Adjectives](https://vaporfigurebed.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com//blogimg/SummaryofAdjectives.png)


## Descriptive Adjecitives

In general, common adjectives are placed before the noun they are
describing.

![EXAMPLE](https://vaporfigurebed.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com//blogimg/general.png)
**Predicate adjectives** are placed after the linking verb
$to \quad be$. They always expand on the subject.


![EXAMPLE](https://vaporfigurebed.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com//blogimg/hamburger.png)
An adjective formed from a proper noun is called a **proper
adjective**. It is always capitalized.


![proper adj](https://vaporfigurebed.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com//blogimg/proper%20adj.png)
## Determiners or Limiting Adjectives

A determiner is placed before the noun it modifies and helps to identify
a specific noun rather than describe it.


![EXAMPLE](https://vaporfigurebed.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com//blogimg/determiners.png)
### Articles

-   Indefinite Articles:$A$ and $an$ refer to one of a general group.

-   Definite Articles：$The$ indicates that the noun (either singular or
    plural) refers to someone or something in particular.

### Possessive Adjectives

Possessive adjectives are derived from these $personal$ $pronouns$[^2]
and express the idea of possession.


![EXAMPLE](https://vaporfigurebed.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com//blogimg/padj.png)
### Demonstrative Adjectives

Demonstrative adjectives point out persons or things.**This** and
**that** are singular; **these** and **those** are
plural.

### Interrogative Adjectives

The interrogative adjectives **which**, **what**, and
**whose**, together with the nouns they modify, are commonly used
to form questions.

### Indefinite Adjectives

Indefinite adjectives indicate nonspecific persons or
things.**Some**, **each**, **any**, **many**,
and **several** are examples of indefinite adjectives.

### Numerical Adjectives

Numerical adjectives indicate quantity by stating a fixed number of
people or things.

## Suffixes and Origin of Adjectives

Suffixes are attached to a root word to form the adjective. These
adjectives originate from other types of words, such as nouns or verbs.

# PRONOUNS

We conclude this chapter with a Venn diagram that summarizes how the
pronoun $trophy$ can be used when forming sentences.


![Overview of Uses of Pronouns](https://vaporfigurebed.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com//blogimg/p.png)
## What Information Do Pronouns Give?

### Uses of Pronouns

Common Uses of Pronouns:

-   To replace people, places, or things: he, it

-   To introduce a question: Who, What

-   To point to a **specific** person, place, or thing: this
    (one), that (one), these, and those

-   To refer to **unnamed**, **nonspecific** people or
    things: Singular: each, somebody, something, or anything.Plural:
    both, several, few, or many.

### Personal Pronouns

$I$, $you$, $he$, $she$, $it$, $we$, $they$

### Grammar Person of Pronouns

Every personal pronoun is classified by whether it is first, second, or
third person.

-   First person pronoun: I, We(Plural)

-   Second person pronoun: You, You(Plural)

-   Third person pronoun: He, She, It, They(Plural)

### Possessive Pronouns

$Mine$, $yours$, $his$, $hers$, $its$, $ours$, $yours$, and $theirs$

### Number of Pronouns

-   Singular:$I$, $you$, $he$, $she$, $it$

-   Plural:$we$, $you$, $they$

### Gender of Pronouns

Gender does not differentiate the pronouns "I," "you," "we," and
"they."
Three genders differentiate the third-person singular pronouns :

-   Masculine Pronoun：he

-   Feminine Pronoun： she

-   Neuter Pronoun: it

We say "generally" here because pronouns do not always follow these
simple rules: Animals are classified as male or female, and sometimes
inanimate objects (such as ships and boats) are referred to as she.

## What Jobs Can Pronouns Do?

The roles pronouns can play divide them into three distinct groups:


![OVERVIEW](https://vaporfigurebed.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com//blogimg/pronoun.png)
### Pronouns as Subjects and Pronouns as Direct Objects


![EXAMPLE](https://vaporfigurebed.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com//blogimg/os.png)
### Pronouns as Objects of Prepositions

Object pronouns can be used to complete a prepositional phrase.


![EXAMPLE](https://vaporfigurebed.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com//blogimg/Pronouns%20as%20Objects%20of%20Prepositions.png)

### Possessive Pronouns


![EXAMPLE](https://vaporfigurebed.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com//blogimg/HERS.png)
### Pronouns as Question Words

-   Question Words Asking About the Subject: $Who$, $What$

-   Question Words Asking About the Object: $Whom$. $What$ plays a
    double role(subject or object).

-   Question Word Asking About a Possessive Noun: $Whose$

# VERBS

This chapter takes a close look at all the jobs verbs can perform.
![Main Verbs and Helping Verbs](https://vaporfigurebed.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com//blogimg/vov.png)

![SUMMARY](https://vaporfigurebed.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com//blogimg/VERB.png)


## FORM OF ENGLISH VERBS

### Verb Families

The infinitive form consists of the word "to" plus the base form of a
verb.

### Types of Verbs

-   Action Verbs: Action verbs express the action, often **physical
    action**, that the subject does.(to eat)

-   Non-Action Verbs: Non-action verbs tell about **states of mind or
    senses**.(to think, to look, and to understand.)

-   Linking Verbs: Linking verbs convey** a state of being**. They
    link the subject of a sentence with a word that renames or describes
    the subject.(**to be**,to appear, to become, to feel, to grow,
    to look, and to taste.)

-   Helping Verbs: Main verb may need a helper to express its full
    meaning: [to be am, are, is, was, were]{.underline} [to do do, does,
    did]{.underline} [to have have, has, ha]{.underline}d [Could, would,
    and must]{.underline}
![A State of Being](https://vaporfigurebed.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com//blogimg/being.png)


### Regular and Irregular Verbs

Verbs change in form. Based on how they change, verbs are divided into
two groups.

### The Four Principal Parts
![The Four Principal Parts](https://vaporfigurebed.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com//blogimg/four.png)


## USES OF ENGLISH VERBS

### Tense

-   Now：Present Tense，Present Continuous

-   Yesterday：Past Tense，Present Perfect

-   Tomorrow: Future Tense

### Modals: Special Helping Verbs

Some common modals are $can$, $could$, $may$, $might$, $must$, $should$,
and $would$

Modals as helping verbs express:

-   possibility or necessity

-   ability or permission

-   polite requests

### Linking and Non-Action Verbs as Main Verbs

When looking at the definitions of verb tenses, the terms $action$ and
$condition$ appear often.They indicate $conditions$ showing what the
subject is, or is like.It can be used as a main verb, just like other
verbs.

-   Linking Verbs: $be$

-   Non-Action Verbs: $have$

### Verbs in Questions and Statements

There are two main kinds of questions in English:

-   Questions beginning with a main or helping verb(direct questions) A
    form of "to do," in either present or past tense, must be used to
    form questions, unless the main verb is the linking verb "to be."

-   Questions beginning with a main or helping verb(information
    question) Like direct questions, most questions that begin with a
    question marker, such as what, why, when, and how, follow inverted
    word order. When "who" or "what" replaces the subject to form a
    question, regular word order applies.

### Verbs with Direct Objects

The direct object names the receiver of an action. It completes the
meaning of the sentence.


![EXAMPLE](https://vaporfigurebed.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com//blogimg/love.png)
### Transitive and Intransitive Verbs

-   Transitive Verbs
    A transitive verb has a direct object. A verb is transitive when an
    object is necessary to complete its meaning in the sentence. The
    action of the verb is transferred to the object.
![EXAMPLE](https://vaporfigurebed.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com//blogimg/t.png)
    
    

-   Intransitive Verbs
    An intransitive verb does not have a direct object. When an object
    is not needed to complete its meaning, the verb is intransitive.
![EXAMPLE](https://vaporfigurebed.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com//blogimg/it.png)
    

    

### Verbs Expressing Commands

A sentence that gives a command or make a request is called an
**imperative sentence**.

# ADVERBS


![SUMMARY](https://vaporfigurebed.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com//blogimg/adv.png)
## What Is an Adverb?

Adverbs act as **modifiers**. The prefix "ad-" in the word adverb
means "to," "toward," or "in addition to." An adverb is a word that is
used with a verb to expand its meaning.

## Five Groups of Adverbs That Modify Verbs

1.  Adverbs of Time: early, today, now, yesterday, before, soon, and
    tomorrow.

2.  Adverbs of Location： above, inside, here, there, and everywhere

3.  Adverbs of Manner：loudly, carefully, well, quickly, and slowly

4.  Adverbs of Degree：completely, nearly, too, almost, very, and fully

5.  Adverbs of Frequency：always, often, sometimes, seldom, and never
    Most

## Adverbs Used to Form Questions

"When," "where," and "how"(interrogative adverbs) are used to form
questions.

## When Adjectives Become Adverbs

Most adjectives become adverbs by adding the suffix -ly. Some examples
of adverbs that cannot be identified as adverbs by looking at a suffix
are **seldom, again, soon, almost, fast,** and **now**.

## When Adverbs Modify Other Adverbs

The meaning of an adverb can be made stronger by adding a second adverb.


![EXAMPLE](https://vaporfigurebed.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com//blogimg/very well.png)
## When Adverbs Modify Adjectives

Adverbs of degree can modify both other adverbs and adjectives.


![EXAMPLE](https://vaporfigurebed.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com//blogimg/verybad.png)
# PREPOSITIONS

## What Is a Preposition?

A preposition is a word or group of words that is placed before a noun
or a pronoun to show a relationship in a sentence.

## Frequently Used Prepositions


![Frequently Used Prepositions](https://vaporfigurebed.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com//blogimg/fp.png)
## Prepositional Phrases with Nouns and Pronouns

A preposition and the object of the preposition form a prepositional
phrase.
![EXAMPLE](https://vaporfigurebed.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com//blogimg/sswh.png)


A pronoun used as the object of a preposition must be an object pronoun;
it cannot be a subject pronoun.

## Extended Units with Direct Objects and Objects of a Preposition
![EXAMPLE](https://vaporfigurebed.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com//blogimg/do.png)

![EXAMPLE](https://vaporfigurebed.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com//blogimg/op.png)


## Some Words Are Both Prepositions and Adverbs

Some words can be used as prepositions when they have an object, but
they can also be used as adverbs when they do not have an object.


![EXAMPLE](https://vaporfigurebed.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com//blogimg/around.png)
# CONJUCTIONS

## What Is a Conjunction?

A conjunction joins words or a group of words of the **same
type**.

-   $and$ expresses addition

-   $or$ expresses a choice

-   $but$ expresses contrast
